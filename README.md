# ShowManager-Old
This project was made for Riga State Technical School as a task. The idea is to keep track of what movies you have watched and want to watch. In this project I tried to keep it organized by making branchees and having pull requests. While I was the only one working on it this workflow could mean any team member could easily join and start developing.

##What I learned
In this project one of the main goals was to learn more about docker (how to set it up to run my project). With docker I could easily have the project running anywhere. I also learned how to keep my code clean and standartised using a linter. One more thing I learned was how to create a GraphQL endpoint in Laravel.

##Requirements

 - NodeJS (Frontend)
 - Laravel (Backend
 - MySQL database
